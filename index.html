                  Our four main purposes are (rescue, adoption, ligation and education). The stray in the shelter are given a great deal of care and love to ensure that they are always happy and healthy.

                   Our vision is to make a difference in the living conditions of all animals through the emotions that stray animals inspire towards humans. Sterilize instead of killing, adopt or sponsor instead of buying pets. Change people's ideas through education and inspire people to coexist peacefully with animals. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="pb-5 text-white text3">
                   It is hoped that the government will increase corresponding measures in rescuing stray pets and implement more stringent legislation to protect animals. To establish a harmonious relationship between humans and animals.

                      The dogâ€™s head is densely packed with so many maggots and they have been drilling inside horribly. There are thousands of them. Maggot wounds emit a strong bad smell. Even us standing at the side feel sick and uncomfortable, not to mention how painful and miserable the dog is.Her left ear was already shaky and was about to fall, because there was no head to let the ear attach to ... The cartilage part of the head has also been eaten by maggots.

                      The vitality of Margot is truly amazing!
                      She has been discharged from the vet clinic and returned to the shelter to recuperate for a while. Every day we have to help her change dressings, apply cream, and feed her medicine. We must keep the wound clean. She is currently recovering very well.We believe that the time for Margot to fully recover will be shorter than we expected, but generally the scars will no longer grow hair after such a severe injury heals

                      This old stray has a huge mammary gland tumor that is bigger than a mango. The tumor even ruptured and was filled with maggots. There were many flies around. It looked like a horrible honeycomb from a distance. It was really terrifying and the dog is in extreme pain.Although she is on drip in the hospital to stablilize for two days and the maggots were all cleaned up by the medical team, Flora was still weak and is not suitable for tumor removal surgery at all, she might need blood transfusion at any time.

                      After being sent to the clinic for diagnosis, it was found that it was because the dog has some ages and multiple bone spurs found in the spine, pressing to the nerve that affects his hind legs and he cannot stand up.Doggie also has maggot wounds on his body, but the vet did not assess this as car accident injury, because the bones of other limbs, pelvis, etc. are not injured.The days being a stray are hard, and it is even harder for old stray.

                     After recuperating in the clinic for a few days, what was exciting was that yesterday the doctor took a video where he could finally stand up and walk to show us!
